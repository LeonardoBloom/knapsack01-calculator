This is my knapsack 0/1 calculator.

To start the program, run "main.py" on an IDE

* For now, you have to edit the code in main.py and change the values for number of items, weight and value, as well as limit weight for the problem to give a desired output. However, soon I will add the ability to perform on user input :)
